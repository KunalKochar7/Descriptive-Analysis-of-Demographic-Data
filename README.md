# Descriptive-Analysis-of-Demographic-Data

The International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau contains various demographic data from 1950 to the present (and projections until 2060) for over 200 countries
with a population of 5,000 or more. The underlying data are based on the respective
countries’ official demographic statistics—e.g. in form of censuses, surveys, administrative records—or on estimates and projections by the U.S. Census Bureau itself.
The data set in the file census_2022_2002.csv contains a small extract from the IDB.
It includes life expectancy at birth and total fertility rates for 228 countries from 2002
and 2022. For the exact definitions of these variables see https://www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/international-programs/about/glossary.html. Life expectancy
is stratified by sex. The countries are divided geographically into 5 regions and 21 subregions. For further details regarding data collection see https://www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/international-programs/about/idb.html.
Tasks:
For tasks 1–3, consider only the year 2022.
1. Describe the frequency distributions of the variables. Consider also the differences
between the sexes.
2. Describe the dependence structure of the involved variables. Are there hints towards monotonic relationships between variables? Are there hints towards functional relationships that are monotone but not linear?
3. Describe the variables’ variabilities within and between subregions.
4. How have the values of the variables changed from 2002 to 2022?
